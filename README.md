Title Chess Game Design with GUI for 2-agents (using searching algorithms)

Description: Design the interface that will allow to play chess between the human user and the system. Assume that the user has two powers (boat and king) and the system has only one king. The game can be ended with a number of points remaining. Initially, the user is given 1000 points as a positive balance. There are some rules and constraints of the game as follows.
A.      The king can move to any direction (up, down, right, left, top-right corner, top-left corner, bottom-right corner, bottom-left corner) but limited to one step at a time.
B.      The boat can move any step-count at a time but in one direction at a time (left, right, up, down). No corner direction allowed.
C.      The boat can not jump any power if it is on its path.
D.      One movement of king is charged by 10 points.
E.       One movement of boat is charged by 20 points.
F.       The king of the system can be killed if it steps into the attacking range of the opponent.
G.      The killing of system king can give earnings of 100 points.
H.      If the user loses its king, it will be charged by -100 points.
